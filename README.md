Dashboard Project
Overview
This project is a responsive dashboard designed to manage multiple steps in a user journey. It includes a Progress Bar that tracks the user's current step, offering a clear indication of progress. The dashboard leverages React, Material UI, and React Router to provide an interactive experience. Additionally, the mobile interface adapts dynamically based on screen size, toggling between a progress bar and a stepper component.

Approach
Component Structure:

The dashboard is built using React with a modular structure. The ProgressBar component controls the display of steps and their progress, while MobileStepper is used to create a more interactive experience on smaller screens.
The ProgressBar shows all steps in a linear fashion, where each step is clickable, and users can jump between them.
On mobile screens, the MobileStepper component is displayed, replacing the progress bar for a more compact and swipeable navigation.
State Management:

The useState hook is used to manage the current step and update it whenever the user clicks a step or navigates using the "Back" and "Next" buttons.
React Router is used for navigation between different stages or screens of the application.
Responsive Design:

The layout of the progress bar and stepper is designed to be responsive. On larger screens, the ProgressBar is displayed, while on smaller screens, the MobileStepper is visible to provide a mobile-friendly interface.
Material UI's grid system and media queries were used to adapt the layout and visibility of components.
Navigation:

Each step is linked to a route, and when a user clicks a step in the progress bar or moves between steps using the MobileStepper, they are navigated to the corresponding route using React Router's useNavigate().
Challenges and Solutions
Responsive Design:

Challenge: Ensuring that the dashboard layout worked seamlessly across different screen sizes.
Solution: I used Material UI's built-in responsive utilities (sx prop) and CSS flexbox to ensure the progress bar adapts to various screen sizes. For mobile devices, I integrated the MobileStepper for easy navigation.
Navigation Between Steps:

Challenge: Managing navigation and keeping track of the current step when using multiple components like the progress bar and stepper.
Solution: I used the React Router's useNavigate hook along with useState to maintain and update the current step. This ensures users can both navigate through steps sequentially and jump directly to a step via clicks.
Mobile-First Approach:

Challenge: Ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile devices while maintaining functionality on larger screens.
Solution: I conditionally rendered the progress bar or stepper based on the screen size using Material UI’s useMediaQuery hook. This allowed me to keep the interface clean and interactive for mobile users while retaining full functionality on desktop.
Assumptions
The project assumes that the user is navigating through a series of steps with a predefined order and that jumping between steps is acceptable.
The interface should be simple yet informative, guiding users through their tasks with a clear visual representation of their progress.
The application supports mobile devices and desktops, and responsive behavior was prioritized.
Future Enhancements
Dynamic Step Management: Implement dynamic steps based on the user’s input or status rather than hardcoding each step.
User Authentication: Adding authentication to protect certain steps or routes based on user roles.
Better Error Handling: Implement error boundaries and provide user feedback in case of navigation or data loading failures.
